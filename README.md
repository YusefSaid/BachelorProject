Web Application for Automation Tools with Integrated Chatbot

This web application has been developed to organize various automation tools, including an integrated chatbot. The purpose of the application is to monitor and control the execution of different automation processes. The task was assigned to us by Continental Tires. The task description spanned approximately 3-4 pages and served as our reference point. The work followed an Iterative Waterfall model with limited communication with the client. The client had clear requirements in the task description and specific desires for the functionality of the web application.

We succeeded in fulfilling most of the requirements and ultimately delivered a well-functioning web application in line with the client's wishes. The final application possesses the necessary features to ensure operations and facilitate future development.

During the project, I had primary responsibility for several tasks:

1. Project Management: I acted as the project manager, assuming responsibility for the administration and organization of project execution. This encompassed planning meetings with mentors and other involved parties to ensure successful completion.

2. Frontend and Backend Development: I was involved in both frontend and backend development of the application, focusing on implementing essential functionalities.

3. Reporting and Documentation: I was accountable for progress reporting and documenting key aspects of the project. This also involved structuring the report layout.

4. Architecture Design: I designed the architecture for both the frontend and backend to ensure a robust and scalable solution.

In the project, there were two of us working closely together. We received a grade of C for the project, which was approved. The entire project is available on my personal GitHub profile for further reference.
